NI Reaktor and Beyond
=====================

Slides and example content from my [MIDIhack day](http://www.midihack.com/) presentation "NI Reaktor and Beyond" on Saturday, 9th May 2015. I explain the programming concepts in Reaktor and show how to interface it with the outside world using OSC. 

Examples cover: 
* the iOS MultiTouch controller app [KonkreetPerformer](https://vimeo.com/19272580)
* the multipurpose toolkit [vvvv](http://vvvv.org/) focusing on gfx programming
* a self-hacked [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) web interface using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the server side
